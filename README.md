Tired of boring, monotonous alerts? Want every event to make players excited? Then **NeyBroadcast** is exactly what you need. It's not just a message plugin - it's a full-fledged alert/purchase/advertising system designed to turn your server into a lively, breathing community where every player feels a part of something bigger.

**NeyBroadcast** combines three key features that used to require three different plugins:
**âœ… Alerts** - important news, events, and announcements.
**âœ… Ads** - promotion of teams, events, store.
**âœ… Purchases** - purchase of in-game items.

**All this** - with support for **HEX** colors, integration with Vault and flexible configuration via config.yml. You yourself decide how messages will look: text, color, sound, maximum length - everything is under your control.
